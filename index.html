            <h2>What is Gender Equality?</h2>
            <p>Gender equality is the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of women, men, girls, and boys. It implies that the interests, needs, and priorities of each gender are respected equally and do not determine their roles and responsibilities in society and private life.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why Gender Equality Matters</h2>
            <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. Gender equality is essential for economies and communities to thrive. When women are empowered, whole societies benefit.</p>

            <h2>Strategies to Address Gender Bias</h2>
            <p>Addressing gender bias requires a multifaceted approach, including but not limited to the following areas:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Education and Awareness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Curriculum Design:</strong> Introduce courses on gender equality and anti-gender bias in schools and universities. Use case studies and discussions to help students understand the impact of gender bias on society.</li>
                <li><strong>Workshops and Training:</strong> Organize workshops and training sessions in workplaces and communities to teach people how to recognize and combat gender bias. Examples include anti-bias training and unconscious bias training.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Policy and Legal Reforms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equal Pay Legislation:</strong> Advocate for laws ensuring equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. Implement transparent pay structures to prevent gender pay gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Family-Friendly Policies:</strong> Develop policies that support work-life balance, such as maternity and paternity leave, and flexible working hours, to alleviate the dual burden often faced by women.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Workplace Culture Change</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion Policies:</strong> Companies should establish Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) policies to ensure fairness in hiring, promotion, and compensation. Appoint dedicated D&I officers to oversee the implementation of these policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Performance Evaluations:</strong> Incorporate gender equality metrics in performance evaluations to ensure fairness. Avoid biased assessments that lead to unjust treatment based on gender.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Media and Representation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diverse Role Models:</strong> Media should showcase diverse gender roles and avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. For example, depict women in a variety of professions and roles in films, TV shows, and advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Gender Equality:</strong> Media content should reflect anti-gender bias messages, promoting the importance of gender equality and reducing the spread of negative gender stereotypes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By implementing these comprehensive strategies, we can build a more equitable and inclusive society, effectively addressing the issue of gender bias.</p>
